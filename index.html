                <p>I'm a web developer who wants to learn every day about how things works, and where do I fit in
                    software
                    development scenario.
                    Since I was 8 years old I spend a lot of time on the computer, but it was 2016 when I started to
                    learn
                    how to code and fell in love with Logic programming.
                </p>
                <ul class="experience-list">
                    <li>
                        From 2016 to 2018 I coursed my higher education and awarded the academic degree on Systems
                        analysis.
                        With it, I learned an important portion of the concepts and fundaments that I use as a base, and
                        I
                        had
                        contact with extraordinary people who guide me along the way of personal and professional
                        development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From 2018 to 2019 I worked in a company who develops custom software. With it, I had the
                        opportunity
                        to be part of agile groups, learned from some specialists with a lot of experience, and trained
                        my
                        tech
                        and communication ability with them.

                        Since 2019 I work as a freelancer, this way I can have direct contact with the clients, making
                        the
                        development more custom and agile.

            <p>When I started to study React and Noje JS, I created an simple project to train the basic concepts like
                API, Redux, Componentization, components params, and others. A part of this test project is an "clicker
                game" where you can gain coins in different ways and use these coins to buy upgrades.

            <p>I forked an clone of the education game kahoot and changed the used database. This way the game can run
